Overstock.com, Inc. is an American internet retailer headquartered in Midvale, Utah,[1] near Salt Lake City.[2] Overstock.com was originally founded in 1997 by Robert Brazell as D2: Discounts Direct. Two years later, it was sold to Patrick M. Byrne who renamed it Overstock.com. The company initially sold exclusively surplus and returned merchandise on an online e-commerce marketplace, liquidating the inventories of at least 18 failed dot-com companies at below-wholesale prices.[3] The company continues to sell home decor, furniture, bedding, and many other goods that are closeout merchandise;[4] however, it also sells new merchandise.
