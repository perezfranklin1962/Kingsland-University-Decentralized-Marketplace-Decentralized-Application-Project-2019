Isabel Amengual started the company back in 1967 in St Thomas.  Over the course of 26 years, she opened distribution facilities on Caribbean islands including St Thomas, St Croix, and Anguilla.  Each facility has gone through upgrades and renovations to establish Merchants Market as the leading and largest broad line distributor with warehouse space in the USVI and Leeward Islands.

In December of 2013, the Merchants companies were bought by Clare Holdings.   New ownership made a significant investment in the facilities, delivery equipment and information systems and made a commitment to operational best practices aimed at bringing more value to our customers and raising the level of customer service.

Strategically located within the Port of Palm Beach, Merchants services not only their distribution centers and distribution partners on Tortola and Virgin Gorda, but many direct customers throughout the Caribbean.  Experts in procurement and logistics, we can provide food storage and consolidation services (FCL and LCL) as well as all product documentation services.

With an experienced team with over 100 years expertise in procurement and logistics, our concentration on quality products and service has earned the company loyalty and trust from its customers and its vendors. Customers know they can depend on the stable, dedicated and experienced staff, many of who have more than a decade of service as part of the Merchants family. In addition to EXCELLENT service and QUALITY products, we are a “one-stop shop” providing over 10,000 frozen, chill, and dry items from well known, trusted brands.
