description:
The Vermont Country Store is owned by Lyman Orton and sons Cabot, Gardner. and Eliot. Together, we are 7th & 8th generation Vermonters, and 4th & 5th generation storekeepers. We still adhere to the old-fashioned values set forth by our father and grandfather Vrest and take pride in being the Purveyors of the Practical and Hard-to-Find. From our two stores, catalog, and website, we're stocked to the rafters with quality merchandise from around the block and around the world. Speaking for the family, Eliot Orton: "We still go to great lengths to find products that aren't sold anywhere else."
