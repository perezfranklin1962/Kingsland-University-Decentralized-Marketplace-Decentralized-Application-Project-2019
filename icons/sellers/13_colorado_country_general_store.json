We are a local small General Store and Souvenir Shop in Empire, Colorado serving any local general goods needs. We are located across the street from the Valero gas station and also across the street from Jenny’s Restaurant on the corner. We carry a wide variety of necessities for locals and tourists, such as milk: eggs, bread, bacon, sandwich meat, cereal, boxed pastas, canned veggies, laundry soap, cleaning supplies, pet food, OTC pharmacy items, health and beauty items, auto, hardware, and stationary items, as well as some camping supplies and hunting/fishing licenses are sold here.

On our souvenir side, we carry Colorado shirts, and long sleeves, hoodies, ski pants in kids and adults sizes. We also have souvenirs such as stickers, shot glasses, mugs, magnets, key chains, custom and locally made cornhole boards, locally made cornhole bags, and locally made travel pillows. We also have some oxygen canisters with fun flavors you can use to help with the altitude or for better performance on the slopes! If we’re missing something we carry here come on by and let us know! If there is an item you need we can have most things shipped in within 48 hours for customers that would like to make a request.
