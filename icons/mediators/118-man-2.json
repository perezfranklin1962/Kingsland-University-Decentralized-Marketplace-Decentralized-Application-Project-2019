description:
Over the past 25 years, licensed attorney and supreme court certified mediator Nick Buoniconti has represented thousands of clients in litigation matters. This includes personal injury and insurance defense litigation, civil and commercial litigation, construction and contract litigation, real estate foreclosures and international law matters. In addition, Nick has donated his time as a pro bono attorney for the Orange County Bar Association.

If you are involved in a dispute heading towards litigation or already in litigation, Nick’s knowledge of these litigation matters from both sides of the isle is invaluable in dispute resolution. Nick’s experience in trial has provided him the understanding of the issues facing both parties. This trial experience also provides him the knowledge of what the parties must do to prepare for trial, the expenses involved with trial and the uncertainty of the outcome. It’s this experience he takes to the field of mediation in his aggressive mediation tactics. Nick will not simply be a mouthpiece for each side but will tell it like it is in his no sugar coated approach.

“Too many mediators simply deliver the message to and from each of the parties. I will tell it like it is, whether they really want to hear it or not.”

Nick is an active member of the Central Florida community. He is heavily involved in the Buoniconti Fund To Cure Paralysis.
