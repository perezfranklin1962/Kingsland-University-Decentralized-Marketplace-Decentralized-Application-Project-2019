Vivian Berger is the Nash Professor of Law Emerita at Columbia University School of Law. She devotes the bulk of her professional time to ADR — mainly, mediation and mainly in the employment area, handling discrimination, contract and wages and hours claims. She has presided over hundreds of mediations and been designated an Advanced Practitioner in employment mediation by the Association for Conflict Resolution. She has taken numerous advanced trainings relevant to employment mediation, as well as basic mediation trainings at Harvard Law School and CDR Associates; coached mediators in training; and spoken on mediation-related topics.

Vivian is on the AAA Employment Mediation Panel and on the mediator panels of the US District Courts for both the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York and the New Jersey State court system, for which she handles mainly employment disputes. In the employment area, she has also mediated for the EEOC (both federal agency and non-federal agency cases), the United States Postal Service (the "REDRESS" program), and the NYS Division of Human Rights. She mediates privately as well, and has served as a special master in a sexual harassment case in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Outside the employment area, Vivian has mediated cases in a number of contexts, including PINS and child custody, citizen-police, and disciplinary proceedings against lawyers.

In addition, Vivian serves on the employment arbitration panel of the AAA, and she was formerly a  FINRA arbitrator.
