description:
The only lasting peace is the one built by the disputants themselves. Mediators Beyond Borders International (MBBI) works to bring mediation and peace skills to communities around the globe so that they can, in turn, build a more peace “able” world. To this end, MBBI organizes initiatives to address three essential objectives: Capacity building, promoting mediation through advocacy, and delivering consultancy services.
